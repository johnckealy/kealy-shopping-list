*A shopping list app*

A bit of a throwaway app, I wrote this in two days; I was the designed shopper for the family, since I was the least likely to die from COVID-19 (at least in theory). I had so many shopping lists to merge into one, and then collate the cost for everyone, so I wrote an app to help me handle it. 

It actually turned out pretty nice.
